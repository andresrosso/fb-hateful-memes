# Hateful Memes Challenge and data set for research on harmful multimodal content

Take an image, add some text: you've got a meme. Internet memes are often harmless and sometimes hilarious. However, by using certain types of images, text, or combinations of each of these data modalities, the seemingly non-hateful meme becomes a multimodal type of hate speech, a hateful meme.

The objective is to develop a multimodal model for detecting hateful memes. This is a hard problem, because relying on just text or just images might lead to lots of false positives. That's why the team at Facebook AI has developed a brand new dataset designed to encourage well-developed mutimodal modeling solutions.

Hateful Memes data set contains 10,000+ new multimodal examples created by Facebook AI. We licensed images from Getty Images so that researchers can use the data set to support their work. We are also releasing the code for baseline-trained models.

We are also launching the Hateful Memes Challenge, a first-of-its-kind online competition hosted by DrivenData with a $100,000 total prize pool. The challenge has been accepted as part of the NeurIPS 2020 competition track.
